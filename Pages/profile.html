                <h1>Profile</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>I'm currently 20 years old and am a full-time student at the University of Penn State studying Computer Science. I enjoy being active in the Penn State community and taking 
                  advantage of any oportunities to further my career development and knowledge areas. I hold an executive position for the Penn State branch of Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) and also do part-time research 
                  during the semester at Applied Cognitive Research Laboratory (ARL), where we focus on analyzing human-computer interaction.
                </p>
                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>Although I am pursuing a full-stack breadth of knowledge, I find particular enjoyment in Frontend development. I have always had a creative mind, and I look at web design as a chance to unleash that creativity in a productive way. So far, I've coded several web pages in just valilla HTML/CSS/JS, but also using 
                  frameworks. Some examples include a functional Google clone, and Harvard course final project, and this website itself. <br>
                  <br> Another creative release I enjoy is game development, particularly in the 3D environment. I am currently working on mastering 3D modeling in Blender with the goal of importing my models to the Unity Game Engine and bringing them to life
                  with code. I hope to release one of my games soon. I have several 3D models that I am proud of already, and more to come.<br>
                  <br> On top of all of my technical hobbies, I also strive to remain healthy and not let my desk bound occupation get the best of me. I enjoy lifting and run a 4-day split consistently, with agility and mobility work sprinkled in here and there.</p>
